Markov text synthesis meets Tamagotchi. A toy for your browser, written by [us](https://github.com/lynn/wordpet/graphs/contributors). [**Play it here!**](https://lynn.github.io/wordpet)

The sound effects are from a really old version of RuneScape. I have no idea where I got them, but they were on my hard drive, waiting to be put to good use (I hope nobody minds). All the graphics and source code are ours, though.
